<h1>Hi there, I'm Lucy!</h1>

I'm currently a Software Engineering student with double minors in Web Development and Database Design & Development at Rochester Institute of Technology, graduating in May 2027. I'm open to Spring or Summer 2026 internships where I can apply my skills while gaining hands-on-experience and learning new technologies. I specialize in back-end development using my most proficient languages like Python and Java, but I'm always open to expanding my knowledge in front-end development as that's something I'm currently working on!

💫I love collecting little trinkets and blind box figurines! Don't ask me how much I've spent...

📝 Currently learning: AWS certification!
📝 Currently project: Course Management Tool for RIT faculty
