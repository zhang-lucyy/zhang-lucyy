<h1>Hi there, I'm Lucy!</h1>

I'm currently a 4th year Software Engineering student with double minors in Web Development and Database Design & Development at Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm open to 2025 internships where I can apply my skills while gaining hands-on-experience and learning new technologies. I specialize in back-end development using my most proficient languages like Python and Java, but I'm always open to expanding my knowledge in front-end development as that's something I've started to develop interest in.

💫I love collecting little trinkets and blind box figurines! Don't ask me how much I've spent...

📝 Currently working on: AWS certification!
